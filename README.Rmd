# Introduction
The `carecompare` package is an `R` toolkit built to enable US hospitals and health systems to access, explore, and analyze performance in [quality measures and payment programs](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/) from the [_Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services_](https://www.cms.gov/) _(CMS)_.

topics

# Examine the metadata for a given topic
hospital_data <- pdc_datasets("Hospitals")
hospital_data

# Search for a dataset
hospital_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(
    title %>%
      stringr::str_detect(
        pattern = "(?i)readmission"
      )
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "pandoc")

# Import the data for a given dataset
